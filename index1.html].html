<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 38px; color: bisque; "> The language movement took place in 1952 in the East Pakistan. People organized the movement demanding the Bangla should be declared the official language. On 21st February 1952, police fired at the rally and killed dozens of people including Abul, Salam, Abdul. This eventually led to the war of 1972.   </p>
